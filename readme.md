The idea for this script is shamelessly copied from https://github.com/BergWerkGIS/convert-bev-address-data

## Why?

The original script only runs on Windows systems. This one performs the same task as the original, but relies on Python.
The gdal Python-Module or ArcPy (much, much slower!) needs to be installed to perform reprojection.

## Usage

The main difference to the original is that you do not need to specify an input file name. ~~Just execute the script from within the unzipped data from the BEV.~~ The newest version of this script attempts to download the data directly. Of course, you can just put the *.zip file (or its extracted content) in the same directory as the script to avoid an automatic download.

### Command Line Arguments

* The default coordinate system of the output file is EPSG:3035 (http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/), one of the European coordinate systems used by INSPIRE (http://inspire.ec.europa.eu) , by default, but can be specified manually by the -epsg parameter. To produce an output in the Austrian Lambert system, the program call would look like this: `python3 convert-addresses.py -epsg 31287` . To produce an output in the WGS84 system, the call has to be performed like this: `python3 convert-addresses.py -epsg 4326`

* To sort the output use the -sort parameter and specify the field to be sorted (e.g. `-sort plz`). The field can be one of gemeinde, plz, strasse, nummer, hausname, x, y, gkz.
